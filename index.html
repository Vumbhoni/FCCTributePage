              <p>
                February 18th, born Audrey Geraldine Lorde Lorde was born in New York City to Caribbean immigrants, her father from Barbados and her mother Grenadian from the island of Carriacou. 
                As a child, Lorde struggled with communication, and came to appreciate the power of poetry as a form of expression. She began writing poetry at the age 12.

              <h2>1950s</h2>
              <p>She attended Hunter College High School, a secondary school for intellectually gifted students, and graduated in 1951. While attending Hunter, Lorde published her first poem in Seventeen magazine after her school's literary journal rejected it for being inappropriate.</p>
              <p>In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the National University of Mexico, a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal. During this time, she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as both a lesbian and a poet.[11] On her return to New York, Lorde attended Hunter College, and graduated in the class of 1959. While there, she worked as a librarian, continued writing, and became an active participant in the gay culture of Greenwich Village. She furthered her education at Columbia University, earning a master's degree in library science in 1961. During this period, she worked as a public librarian in nearby Mount Vernon, New York</p>

                <h2>1960s</h2>
                <p>In 1968 Lorde was writer-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi.
                   Lorde's time at Tougaloo College, like her year at the National University of Mexico, was a formative experience for her as an artist. 
                   She led workshops with her young, black undergraduate students, many of whom were eager to discuss the civil rights issues of that time. 
                   Through her interactions with her students, she reaffirmed her desire not only to live out her "crazy and queer" identity, 
                   but also to devote attention to the formal aspects of her craft as a poet. Her book of poems, Cables to Rage, 
                   came out of her time and experiences at Tougaloo</p>
                   <p>Lorde taught in the Education Department at Lehman College from 1969 to 1970.</p>

                <h2>70s & 80s</h2>
                <p>From 1972 to 1987, Lorde resided in Staten Island. During that time, in addition to writing and teaching she co-founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.
                    As a professor of English at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (part of the City University of New York) from 1970 to 1981. There, she fought for the creation of a black studies department.

                <p>
                    In 1981, Lorde was among the founders of the Womenâ€™s Coalition of St. Croix,[9] an organization dedicated to assisting women who have survived sexual abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV). In the late 1980s, she also helped establish Sisterhood in Support of Sisters (SISA) in South Africa to benefit black women who were affected by apartheid and other forms of injustice.
                    In 1985, Audre Lorde was a part of a delegation of black women writers who had been invited to Cuba. The trip was sponsored by The Black Scholar and the Union of Cuban Writers. She embraced the shared sisterhood as black women writers. They visited Cuban poets Nancy Morejon and Nicolas Guillen. They discussed whether the Cuban revolution had truly changed racism and the status of lesbians and gays there.

                <p>Lorde was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1978 and underwent a mastectomy. Six years later, she was diagnosed with liver cancer. After her first diagnosis, she wrote The Cancer Journals, which won the American Library Association Gay Caucus Book of the Year Award in 1981.
                    Lorde died of liver cancer at the age of 58 on November 17, 1992, in St. Croix, where she had been living with Gloria I. Joseph. In an African naming ceremony before her death, she took the name Gamba Adisa, which means "Warrior: She Who Makes Her Meaning Known".
